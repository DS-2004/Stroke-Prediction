Stroke Prediction Using Machine-Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting stroke risk based on patient health data. It leverages medical datasets containing features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, BMI, and glucose levels. Various classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks) are trained and evaluated for accuracy. The model helps in early detection, enabling timely medical intervention and reducing stroke-related fatalities.
